# Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm Ryan and I'm a developer!

## 💁‍♂️ About me
- love full stack web dev 👨‍💻
- interested in computer vision 🤖
- want to improve with distributed systems 🤔

## 📚 About my profile
I try to put any repo's that relate to the same project into a seperate github orginization just to keep track of them better

## 🚀 Projects

### ✂️ [Highlight-inator](https://github.com/auto-highlighter)
This is a tool that automatically creates highlight videos from live streams. Still a long way from finishing this one, but its the one I'm most excited about! Unfortunately theres no demo due to hosting costs and some of this is closed source.

### 📜 [Blog](https://github.com/Dev-Ryan-Blog)
As you might have guessed, its my personal blog! It's a recent addition, but I'm hoping getting better writing about tech will help strengthen my skills overall and also give me a good excuse to try new things 😅

### 🎤 [Losing The Lyrics](https://github.com/RyanCallahan312/losing-the-lyrics)
Traditional karaoke gamified! This is a web game based on a 2007 show called "Don't Forget The Lyrics". Each player takes a turn trying to complete a the lyrics in a song after the music stops. The only caviate to this is the person hosting the game needs a spotify premium account in order to play.

### 🖥️ [Portfolio Site](https://github.com/dev-ryan-portfolio)
I guess this isn't much of a project, but I've made myself five portfolio sites over the years and it has come a very long way. The original was a 480p meme image as the background for each plain html page and now it's a Next.js site using Chakra UI and threejs!
